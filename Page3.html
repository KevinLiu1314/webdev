        The Flying Dragons (traditional Chinese: 飛龍幫; simplified Chinese: 飞龙帮; pinyin: Fēilóngbāng; Jyutping: Fei1lung4bong1) are a well known Chinese American street gang affiliated with the Hip Sing Tong; they are active in New York City's Chinatown, and have a presence in Hong Kong, Canada and Australia. The gang moved heavily into heroin trafficking after the Italian-American Mafia lost the trade as a result of the Pizza Connection prosecutions in the mid-1980s. The Flying Dragons was believed to be started somewhere in the late 1890s to early 1900s.

        Similar to the Triads of China, and the Yakuza of Japan, The Flying Dragons are likely to operate with people of their own ethnicity. Unlike Western gangs, gangs such as the Flying Dragons remain fairly unnoticeable by police outside of their own homelands. In the leader's, Johnny "onionhead" Eng's criminal case, it is reported The Flying Dragons are a fairly violent gang; being involved in murders and drug trafficking.
